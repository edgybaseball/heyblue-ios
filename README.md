#Hey Blue! Mobile Application

This project was developed using Ionic 2 Framework

##To run the project:	

```npm install```

```ionic serve --lab```

Your default browser should open.

####Use Chrome browser for emulation. Layout in other browser is not guaranteed.
	
##This project was generated using ionic RC0. there is a breaking change that prevent the app from working. I suggest that a new project be scaffolded from ionic start command and copy paste the code that has been added from this project. ionic2 custom icons should be either be upgraded or removed if ionic natively accepts custom icon sets
